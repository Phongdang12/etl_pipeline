The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.Learn more:Learn more about the health risksSign up for recall notifications by email and follow us on social mediaView our detailed explanation of the food safety investigation and recall processReport a food safety or labelling concern","Category":"Fresh","Recall class":"Class 2","Last updated":"2024-12-21","Archived":"0"},{"NID":"76711","Title":"Unbranded Blue Beam Laser Pointer and JD-303 Green Laser Pointer recalled due to eye injury hazard ","URL":"https:\/\/recalls-rappels.canada.ca\/en\/alert-recall\/unbranded-blue-beam-laser-pointer-and-jd-303-green-laser-pointer-recalled-due-eye","Organization":"Consumer product safety","Product":"Unbranded Blue Beam Laser Pointer and JD-303 Green Laser Pointer","Issue":"Injury hazard","What you should do":"Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled lasers and return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.For more information, consumers can contact International Camouflage Ltd. by telephone at 1-877-315-2266, Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm PST, or by email at sales@camouflage.ca.Handheld lasers that are Class 3B or Class 4 fall under Table 3 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act general prohibitions.
